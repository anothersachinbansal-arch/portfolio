          <h2 className="section-title">üëã Who I Am</h2>
          <p className="description">
            I‚Äôm <strong>Sachin Bansal</strong>, a passionate teacher and mentor
            based in Vikaspuri, New Delhi. I specialize in Political Science and
            currently serve as a PGT at Mamta Modern Sr. Sec. School. Teaching
            for me is not just a career‚Äîit‚Äôs a way to shape young minds and
            inspire growth.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-title">üìö My Teaching Journey</h2>
          <p className="description">
            My teaching journey began in <strong>2016</strong> when I launched a
            small YouTube channel, <strong>SOL Updates</strong>, to help
            undergraduate students in Political Science. What started as a few
            videos turned into a thriving community of{" "}
            <strong>1,00,000+ learners</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="description">
            Since 2017, I have been teaching Social Sciences and mentoring
            students for board exams and beyond. While many of my students
            proudly score 90+ marks, I believe true success lies in helping them
            become more confident, capable, and better than yesterday.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-title">üå± Beyond the Classroom</h2>
          <p className="description">
            In 2019, I founded the <strong>Secular House Foundation</strong>, an
            NGO that works on literacy, culture, and education under the motto{" "}
            <em>Read, Write, and Recite</em>. Through this initiative, I‚Äôve
            organized open mics, workshops, and cultural events in Delhi
            University colleges, creating spaces where young voices can be heard
            and celebrated.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-title">‚úç Author & Mentor</h2>
          <p className="description">
            I‚Äôve authored Political Science books for Class 11 and 12, combining
            academic knowledge with classroom experience to make learning
            meaningful and relatable.
          </p>
          <p className="description">
            <strong>My academic journey includes:</strong>
            <br />‚Ä¢ B.A. (Hons.) Political Science

          <h2 className="section-title">‚ù§ My Belief</h2>
          <p className="description">
            At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt measure my success in numbers or
            grades. My real achievement is seeing my students grow into
            confident individuals who discover their own potential and keep
            moving forward‚Äîone step at a time.
